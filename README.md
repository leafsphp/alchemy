Alchemy is a modern and delightful PHP testing library focused on simplicity and developer experience. We believe that testing should not be a pain: you should focus on building your app instead.

Alchemy is heavily inspired by [Facebook's Jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) and uses some concepts from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to provide the easiest and simplest tests known to PHP.

## üì¶ Installation

You can quickly install alchemy with composer

```sh
leaf install alchemy
```

Or with composer

```sh
composer require leafs/alchemy
```

## üóÇ Getting Started

By default, alchemy will look for a `test` or `tests` folder in the root of your project and will run all files in the directory that end with `.test.php`. If both of these directories exist, alchemy will use only the `tests` directory.

Also, Alchemy allows you to group tests under `feature` and `unit` directories which run feature and unit tests respectively. If a test is written outside of these directories, it is automatically treated as a unit test.

All of these coupled with other features means that you can install Alchemy and start writing your tests immediately without doing any configuration.

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Writing tests

After installing Alchemy, create a `tests` directory and add a new file, eg: `example.test.php`

```php
test('n is null', function () {
  $n = null;
  expect($n)->toBeNull();
});
```

> Note that Alchemy will only run files with the `.test.php` extension. This is to give more room for setup files and more.

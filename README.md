Alchemy is a Leaf module which allows you to quickly and efficiently create and run tests in your Leaf apps. Leaf 3 is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with Pest PHP/PHPUnit is included out of the box. However, Alchemy allows you to avoid all the hustle and write your tests without having to setup anything. Just create your `test`/`tests` folder and start writing your tests.

## üì¶ Installation

You can quickly install alchemy with leaf CLI

```sh
leaf install alchemy
```

Or with composer

```sh
composer require leafs/alchemy
```

## üóÇ Getting Started

By default, alchemy will look for a `test` or `tests` folder in the root of your project and will run all files in the directory that end with `.test.php`. If both of these directories exist, alchemy will use only the `tests` directory.

Also, Alchemy allows you to group tests under `feature` and `unit` directories which run feature and unit tests respectively. If a test is written outside of these directories, it is automatically treated as a unit test.

All of these coupled with other features means that you can install Alchemy and start writing your tests immediately without doing any configuration.

> Alchemy is a test runner, not a testing framework.

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Writing tests

After installing Alchemy, create a `tests` directory and add a new file, eg: `example.test.php`

```php
test('n is null', function () {
  $n = null;
  expect($n)->toBeNull();
});
```

> Note that Alchemy will only run files with the `.test.php` extension. This is to give more room for setup files and more.
